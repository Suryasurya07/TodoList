ReactJS To-Do Application with API Integration
Task Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced To-Do application using ReactJS, Redux for state management, and external API integration. The application includes features such as task management, task prioritization, authentication, and responsive design.

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your proficiency in React, Redux, API integration, and building a responsive user interface.

Features
Frontend Development & API Integration:

HTML for structuring the app layout.
CSS (with optional frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI) for styling.
API integration with a public API (e.g., Weather API) to display relevant task data.
Error handling for API requests.
React Components & State Management:

Application built with functional components and React hooks (useState, useEffect).
TaskInput component to add a task.
TaskList component to display tasks.
Redux (with Redux Thunk or Redux Saga) to handle asynchronous API calls.
Responsive Design:

Ensure mobile-first, responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Core Functionality:

Add Task: Allow users to input and add tasks.
View Tasks: Display tasks in a list format.
Delete Task: Remove tasks by clicking a delete button.
Task Prioritization: Set and display task priorities (High, Medium, Low).
Persistent Storage: Use local storage/session storage for data persistence across browser sessions.
User Authentication:

Mock user authentication (login/logout) with Redux state management.
Protect To-Do list from unauthorized access.
Project Structure & Code Quality:

Organize code with best practices for scalability and maintainability.
Use clean, well-commented code adhering to React best practices.
Requirements
ReactJS for front-end development.
Redux for state management (use Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for async actions).
HTML & CSS (Bootstrap/Material-UI optional).
Public API (e.g., weather API) for external data integration.
Responsive layout (CSS Grid/Flexbox).
Local Storage/Session Storage for persistent data storage.
Implement Authentication (mock).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
